# Book Buying and Selling Platform

## Objective

The objective is to create an innovative platform dedicated to facilitating the buying and selling of new or second-hand books. Recognizing the need for many people to free up space in their homes and dispose of items they no longer need, this initiative aims to provide a virtual space where users can connect easily and safely to buy and sell used products, thus promoting the reuse of items and the circular economy.

## Scope

Designing and launching a C2C e-commerce system specialized in books, making it easier for residents of Barranquilla to search for and acquire new or second-hand books at affordable prices. This system will provide a virtual platform where users can explore a wide variety of books offered by other community members. Sellers can list their books for sale, specifying details such as the book's condition, price, and availability.

Key benefits of this system will include the convenience of finding desired books from the comfort of home, the option to purchase books at cheaper prices compared to traditional stores, and the opportunity to discover used books in good condition that might otherwise be hard to find.
